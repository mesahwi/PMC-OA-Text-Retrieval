Moreover, based upon consultation to the Allen Mouse Atlas of brain gene expression [40], 4 of these (KCNA7, KCND1, KCNK6, and KCTD13) do not appear to be expressed in the mammalian brain, 2 (KCNAB3 and KCNC3) are widely expressed throughout the brain, suggesting a gen- eral functional role, and 3 (KCNN4, KNCJ14, and KCNH3) exhibit regionalized expression that largely overlaps with that of other members of these sub- families, suggesting functional redundancy in their brain distributions. Thus, it appears that the majority of genes that are missing in songbirds (or that are novel in mam- mals), are either not expressed in the brain, or have re- dundant functions with other family members that are present in birds. \n","\n","6 ..... Despite the apparent conservation among vocal learners, we also discovered that the complement of K- Channel genes is highly conserved between zebra finch and chicken, the latter species being incapable of vocal learning. For instance, we found just a single finch gene, KCNE1P that is absent in chicken, and since it is a pseudogene, it is not expected to influence neuronal ex- citability. In fact, nearly every novel K-Channel gene in finch that is absent in humans is present in chicken and/ or other vertebrate taxa, suggesting that many of these genes represent relatively ancient gene duplications that were likely lost in some or in all mammals (Additional file 1: Table S1). Thus, it seems unlikely that K-Channel gene duplication events have played a prom- inent role in the evolution of neural circuitry for learned vocalizations. We next looked for evidence of protein coding insertions/deletions (indels) that might change the function of channels in zebra finches as compared to chickens. Intriguingly, we identified 16 K-Channel genes that contain finch-specific indels within their predicted protein coding domains. However, only two of these K-channels (KCNA4 and KCNA6) had indels within a re- gion containing a predicted functional domain, and in both cases this region is quite variable across taxa (e.g. mouse, lizard, human). Therefore, it seems unlikely that these amino acid substitutions are likely to affect chan- nel function. Finally, our analysis was able to confirm and extend the observation that some K-Channel genes are under high selective pressure in finch compared to chicken [6,12]. We note that our analysis also revealed that nearly half of all K-Channel genes that could be inferred to have high dN/dS ratios based on Ensembl Compara are incorrect, and have artificially high dN/dS ratios that stem from improperly aligned protein coding models, incomplete model predictions, and/or models derived from low quality sequence. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that of the 10 genes with relatively high dN/dS ratios, 6 are members of the KCNK family of 2-TM channels, corresponding to half of all KCNK channels under high selective pressure in zebra finch. We note that this finding is not due to the dispropor- tionate number of KCNK channels in the zebra finch genome, as the KCTD family, the largest family of K-Channel related genes, contains 20 members and just a single gene (KCTD18) under high selective pressure compared to chicken. While the implications of this finding are unclear, they do suggest that specific families of K-Channels may play a more prominent role in the evolution of zebra finches, and/or possibly the songbird lineage. It will be interesting to see if this remains the case for other members of the songbird clade as add- itional genome sequences become available (e.g. [41]). In any case, further analysis revealed just 5 cases where non-conservative amino acid substitutions might be expected to affect a predicted functional domain, and in just two cases (KCNMB1 and KCNK16), we found that the dN/dS ratio comparing lizard vs. finch was higher than that of lizard vs. chicken, suggesting greater divergence in songbirds. Thus, overall, it appears that K-Channel genes are highly conserved among higher vertebrate lineages.

Consistent with our expectations based on the function of K-Channels and their widespread expression in the mammalian brain [42-45], we found evidence for the expression of K-Channel genes encoding pore-forming (i.e., alpha) and accessory (i.e., beta) subunits in every major song nucleus in the adult zebra finch brain (Table 1). In fact, only 3 genes for which we had probes, and were able to detect signal, appear not to be expressed in the song system. Thus, it is possible that combinatorial patterns define the molecular constituents of K-Channels within song nuclei, forming a gene net- work that defines the homeostatic (e.g. membrane and resting potential) as well as dynamic states (e.g. firing rate, spike waveforms, and neurotransmission) of neu-rons that influence the maintenance and production of adult birdsong. However, we also found that more than half of all K-Channel genes (35/56) are differentially expressed (either up or down) in at least one vocal nu- cleus relative to its surrounding brain region. These genes constitute molecular markers of the song system, and they may underlie the unique electrophysiological features that define the properties of neurons in vocal nuclei. A deeper understanding of the roles that these K-Channel markers play in other systems may provide important insights into the cellular properties, firing be- havior, and state dynamics of vocal control pathways.\n","--> Functional tuning of brain circuits for the production and maintenance of learned vocalizations Consistent with our expectations based on the function of K-Channels and their widespread expression in the mammalian brain [42-45], we found evidence for the expression of K-Channel genes encoding pore-forming (i.e., alpha) and accessory (i.e., beta) subunits in every major song nucleus in the adult zebra finch brain (Table 1).

The discovery of bona fide markers based on the comparison of HVC vs. the underlying nidopallial Shelf provides important support for our rationale that HVC constitutes a molecular specialization of the nidopallium that is the product of specific programs of gene regulation. Furthermore, because our micro- array comparison was not to the whole brain, we were able to identify markers that are also expressed in other song nuclei and brain subdivisions in various combinations (Figure 2 and Table S4). Thus, some molecular specializations of HVC potentially reflect properties that are common among subsets of song nuclei. For example, similar to zRalDH, an enrichment in HVC and LMAN may reflect a nidopallial characteristic that is absent from arcopallial and/or striatal nuclei (e.g. the local synthesis of retinoic acid). In contrast, a shared enrichment in HVC and striatal area X might indicate a possible involvement in the establishment and/or function of the HVC-to-X projection system, and a shared enrichment in HVC, RA and LMAN could suggest a molecular pathway related to pallial but not striatal function. We also identified some genes (e.g. CADPS2, NTS and S100B) that showed enrichment in distinct pallial areas such as primary auditory field L2a and somatosensory nucleus basorostralis, suggesting that some molecular properties of HVC may be shared with more general telencephalic subdivisions.

Our results also suggest that axon guidance is an important target of regulation in HVC, and that semaphorin-related (not netrin- related) signaling is a major candidate mediator of axon guidance for HVC neurons. Follow-up in situ analysis further indicates that while NRP1 is primarily expressed in small neurons (possibly RA- projecting cells), the NRP1/PLXNA4 receptor ligand SEMA3A is generally down-regulated in HVC and its targets (i.e. RA and X). In NRP1/PLXN4 expressing cells, SEMA3A typically facilitates the collapse of growth cones and/or formation of fasciculated axon bundles [42,43]. Thus, the apparent absence of SEMA3A in RA may play a permissive role for axon extension from HVC’s RA- projecting cells, which appear to be NRP1-positive. In contrast, SEMA3A expression is highly enriched in a band of cells that lies adjacent to the dorsal arcopallial lamina and is intercalated with nidopallial axonal bundles entering the arcopallium (Figs. 5D and E). These results suggest a possible role for semaphorin-mediated guidance and/or the fasciculation of new axons extending from HVC to RA. A similar role may be served by SEMA3A-expressing cells that are interspersed with the fibers of the occipito- mesencephalicus tract (OM; Fig. 5E). We are currently conducting a comprehensive developmental analysis that should provide additional clues as to potential roles of semaphorins in axon guidance within the song system.\n","--> Our results also suggest that axon guidance is an important target of regulation in HVC, and that semaphorin-related (not netrin- related) signaling is a major candidate mediator of axon guidance for HVC neurons. Follow-up in situ analysis further indicates that while NRP1 is primarily expressed in small neurons (possibly RA- projecting cells), the NRP1/PLXNA4 receptor ligand SEMA3A is generally down-regulated in HVC and its targets (i.e. RA and X). In NRP1/PLXN4 expressing cells, SEMA3A typically facilitates the collapse of growth cones and/or formation of fasciculated axon bundles [42,43]. Thus, the apparent absence of SEMA3A in RA may play a permissive role for axon extension from HVC’s RA- projecting cells, which appear to be NRP1-positive. In contrast, SEMA3A expression is highly enriched in a band of cells that lies adjacent to the dorsal arcopallial lamina and is intercalated with nidopallial axonal bundles entering the arcopallium (Figs. 5D and E). These results suggest a possible role for semaphorin-mediated guidance and/or the fasciculation of new axons extending from HVC to RA. A similar role may be served by SEMA3A-expressing cells that are interspersed with the fibers of the occipito- mesencephalicus tract (OM; Fig. 5E).

Our study also revealed that some HVC markers are linked to cell migration or differentiation, and play important roles in the maturation and integration of post-mitotic cells into mature circuitry, and patterning during development. For example, the extracellular matrix protein TNR plays a unique role in neuronal recruitment out of the migratory stream in the olfactory bulb [52]. Its elevated expression in HVC may thus favor the recruitment of migratory neurons into HVC. ST8SIA4, which is responsible for the sialation of NCAM, is potentially associated with the prominent immunolabeling for poly-sialated NCAM in HVC, thought to be related to the migration of post-mitotic neurons into HVC [53,54]. On the other hand, the low expression of known migration mediators may reflect an overall low rate of cell migration within HVC. While it is difficult to predict the precise impact of regulating this set of genes, we suggest that the markers we have identified may potentially provide signaling cues help guide that could guide the incorporation and maturation of newly- arrived post-mitotic neurons within HVC.\n","--> Our study also revealed that some HVC markers are linked to cell migration or differentiation, and play important roles in the maturation and integration of post-mitotic cells into mature circuitry, and patterning during development.

Forebrain activation Our study is the first that we are aware of to report motor- driven vocalization-related forebrain activation of a laryngeally connected region of primary motor cortex and of the striatum in a non-human mammal. More experiments are required to test if the mouse M1 layer V and striatal neurons exhibit pre-motor activity during USV song production. While our study on mice was in preparation, several studies challenged the claim that non-human primates do not have cortical regions active in the production of vocalizations, using PET neuroimaging, IEG mapping, and electrophysiology [38–41]. The PET study conducted in chim- panzees found that a brain region in a similar location as Broca’s area (i.e. ventral prefrontal cortex) was activated during vocalizing [38]. The IEG studies conducted in marmosets found induced gene expression in prefrontal cortex after animals vocalized [39,40]. The electrophysiology study conducted in macaques found neural firing in the ventral premotor cortex during vocalization [41]. However, the studies did not report whether there was differential activation of M1 or striatum. Additionally, these studies did not control for potential activation driven by auditory feedback by reducing or eliminating auditory input. In the electrophysiology study, neurons fired when the monkey’s produced conditioned vocalizations but not when they produced similar vocalizations spontaneously, suggesting that the brain region is not responsible for motor programming of the vocalizations. If the non-human primate results can be extended to eliminate the possibility of auditory feedback and show some control over the spectral structure of vocalizations, as the present study showed in mice, then such a finding would indicate that forebrain activation for some spectral modulation of vocalizations could be a common feature in mammals.\n","--> Our study is the first that we are aware of to report motor- driven vocalization-related forebrain activation of a laryngeally connected region of primary motor cortex and of the striatum in a non-human mammal.

In our mice studies, we used a transynaptic tracer to identify laryngeally connected motor cortex, whereas the previous studies used conventional tracers starting from orofacial cortical areas or premotor Area 6V. Therefore, the correct cortical area may not have been injected, or a sparse projection may not have been easily noticed. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to inject a tracer exclusively in Amb in mammals or XIIts in birds without leakage in the surrounding reticular formation, due to the motor nucleus’ small diameter. Partly consistent with our alternative hypothesis, a recent study in rats using the same PRV-Bartha transynaptic tracer injected in the larynx found a few isolated labeled cells in M1 more than 120 hrs after injection into laryngeal muscles [30]; however, that study did not discuss the possible implications of this finding or test for a direct projection. Thus, if a transynaptic tracer approach were to reveal a M1 region that projects directly to Amb in non-human primates and other species, even sparsely, then such a finding would prompt a serious re-evaluation of the hypothesis that the direct projection is a specialization of vocal learners [1,6,7,9,13,14,18,19,24–26] (Text S1).

Vocal Imitation Our finding that housing two male mice with a female can result in pitch convergence between those males indicates that mice could possibly ‘‘learn’’ at least one acoustic feature in their vocalizations. The drops in B6 pitch were large (4470686 Hz s.e.m.) and of similar magnitude to changes used as evidence for vocal learning in bats [50]. Although pitch convergence has been reported in non-human primates, the changes were not reliable, and divergence from the normal range occurred in only one of eight animals [51]. That males in our experiment matched the pitch of their specific cage mates suggests that the effects likely occurred through auditory experience with each other. An alternative explanation is that the decline in B6 is due to age related hearing loss in this strain. However, we believe this explanation is unlikely for the following reasons: these mice exhibit moderate hearing loss later in life (after 6 months) [52], and we performed the experiments when they were less than 5 months old; the animals converged to the specific pitch of their cage mates; there was 4 week age offset between the mice in the two treatments studied, with similar results; and, we did not see a similar pitch decrease in one month of recording before cross housing. It is also possible that females shaped the songs by non-vocal reinforcement, as reported for some songbirds [53]. Another possibility is that because most B6 males shifted in the same direction, were smaller than the BxD males, and sang less than BxD males, the B6 males may be matching the pitch of the dominant male whenever a female is present. It is still unclear if mice can match other song features (i.e. frequency modulation and syllable sequencing), if supposed vocal non-learners are capable of pitch convergence, and whether mice (and other supposed vocal non-learners) use similar forebrain circuits as known vocal learners to achieve this feat. This can now be tested in mice by lesioning or blocking M1 and assessing pitch convergence.\n","--> Our finding that housing two male mice with a female can result in pitch convergence between those males indicates that mice could possibly ‘‘learn’’ at least one acoustic feature in their vocalizations.

Our identification of SDs that emerged following evolutionary divergence of Galliformes (e.g. chicken) and Neoaves (e.g. Zebra finch) substantially improves on pre- vious studies [27,36] by refining the location of SD sites, identifying breakpoints on chrs 11–28 and Z, and distin- guishing SDs present in Zebra finch only, thus possibly specific to songbirds, from those present in chicken only, and thus possibly specific to Galliformes. The fact that the majority of novel genes, both those unique to song- birds as well as those present in other avian groups, are located within or immediately adjacent to SDs suggests that chromosomal rearrangement is a major mechanism for the emergence of novel genomic features in passer- ines and other avian groups, as found in other lineages [48,49]. This corroborates previous reports establishing non-allelic homologous recombination following inter- or intra-chromosomal rearrangement as an essential mech- anism for genome evolution [50,51]. Of note, songbird chromosomes 1 and 1A are known to have undergone significant rearrangement, having split from chicken chromosome 1 [52], which our findings suggest has had repercussions for novel gene evolution: a single rearrange- ment on Chr1A can be associated with multiple novel genes; another SD on Chr1 harbours the previously described growth hormone gene duplication (GHL) [53], which we conclude to be passerine-specific. Related to these rearrangements, avian SDs have been previously associated with a high occurrence of repetitive elements [36], which are thought to provide a substrate for non- allelic homologous recombination and genomic instability [54,55].

This is consistent with the effects of TMS to this region (Pobric et al., 2009) and the effects of ATL damage in patients with the neurodegenerative syndrome of semantic dementia (Gorno- Tempini et al., 2011; Hoffman and Lambon Ralph, 2011; Jefferies et al., 2009). Fig. 4 demonstrates the close corre- spondence between the present results and previous TMS and neuropsychological data. The higher spatial resolution of this distortion-corrected fMRI study allowed us to identify sepa- rate activation foci in superior and ventral ATL, with distinct response profiles. A > C activation was observed in sATL as in previous studies of concreteness effects (Binder et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010). However, our novel cueing manipulation indicates that the effect in this area has a different basis to that observed in the IFG. While IFG responded maximally under irrelevant cue conditions, sATL activation was greatest when meanings were processed in a coherent context. This suggests, rather than being involved in executive regulation, sATL may play a role in integrating or enriching a words meaning based on prior context. sATL is strongly associated with auditory-verbal semantic processing: it shows activation for written and spoken words but not for perceptually- matched non-meaningful stimuli (Scott, Blank, Rosen, & Wise, 2000; Spitsyna et al., 2006). It has also been linked with combinatorial semantic processing (i.e., the extraction of a global meaning from a series of words; Hickok & Poeppel, 2007) and with syntactic aspects of sentence comprehension (Humphries, Binder, Medler, & Liebenthal, 2006) because it activates more strongly to sentence stimuli than to lists of unrelated words (Vandenberghe, Nobre, & Price, 2002). This area was more strongly activated when judgements were made following congruent contextual cues, suggesting that it may be involved in integrating relevant contextual informa- tion with the current semantic judgement. This is consistent with involvement combinatorial semantic processing and with the more general role of sATL in verbal comprehension, since discourse processing requires the ongoing integration of information as a conversation unfolds. On this view, sATL showed less activation when the cue was irrelevant because participants rapidly recognised that it was not helpful and disengaged attempts to integrate it.

The second cluster was in vATL and formed part of a long ribbon of activation running along the border of the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri. fMRI in this area can be affected by susceptibility artefacts and signal drop-out (Devlin et al., 2000; Visser et al., 2010); however, when these technical limitations are addressed it has been found to be robustly activated for concrete concepts in a range of semantic tasks (Binney et al., 2010; Vandenberghe et al., 1996; Visser et al., 2012). Here, we established that this area plays an important role in the rep- resenting the meanings of abstract as well as concrete con- cepts. vATL displayed a similar response across all four semantic conditions. It did show an A > C effect, though this was significantly smaller than that observed in sATL, and it showed no significant difference between the two types of cue. Similarly, in previous studies this region has been found to respond uniformly to semantic judgements for spoken words, written words, pictures and non-verbal sounds (Marinkovic et al., 2003; Spitsyna et al., 2006; Visser & Lambon Ralph, 2011), consistent with that view that the wider ATL region acts as transmodal hub that fuses visual, auditory and other sources of information to form coherent concepts (Lambon Ralph, Sage, Jones, & Mayberry, 2010; Patterson et al., 2007). The role of the ATL hub in representing abstract con- cepts is less clear and some authors have questioned whether the hub is involved in representing these concepts (Bonner et al., 2009; Meteyard, Cuadrado, Bahrami, & Vigliocco, 2012; Shallice & Cooper, 2013). This view is motivated in part by a number of prominent single-case studies of patients with ATL damage who display a reversal of the typical concreteness effect e i.e., their comprehension of concrete concepts is disproportionately impaired relative to abstract (e.g., Macoir, 2009; Sirigu, Duhamel, & Poncet, 1991; Warrington, 1975). Some recent studies have failed to find this effect in larger case-series of semantic dementia (Hoffman, Jones, & Lambon Ralph, 2013; Hoffman and Lambon Ralph, 2011; Jefferies et al., 2009), suggesting that the “reversal” cases are unusual anomalies, though other studies are inconsistent with this view (Bonner et al., 2009; Loiselle et al., 2012; Yi, Moore, & Grossman, 2007). This apparent variability among patients with ATL damage may be a consequence of variations in the location and extent of damage in different patients. The pre- sent study allows for a greater degree of anatomical precision than is possible in neuropsychological studies. We found that a key region of vATL cortex e an area that is strongly linked to semantic deficits in semantic dementia (Mion et al., 2010) e is involved in the processing of abstract words as well as con- crete. This suggests that a common temporal lobe system supports comprehension of both word types.\n","--> The second cluster was in vATL and formed part of a long ribbon of activation running along the border of the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri. fMRI in this area can be affected by susceptibility artefacts and signal drop-out (Devlin et al., 2000; Visser et al., 2010); however, when these technical limitations are addressed it has been found to be robustly activated for concrete concepts in a range of semantic tasks (Binney et al., 2010; Vandenberghe et al., 1996; Visser et al., 2012).

Similarly, in previous studies this region has been found to respond uniformly to semantic judgements for spoken words, written words, pictures and non-verbal sounds (Marinkovic et al., 2003; Spitsyna et al., 2006; Visser & Lambon Ralph, 2011), consistent with that view that the wider ATL region acts as transmodal hub that fuses visual, auditory and other sources of information to form coherent concepts (Lambon Ralph, Sage, Jones, & Mayberry, 2010; Patterson et al., 2007). The role of the ATL hub in representing abstract con- cepts is less clear and some authors have questioned whether the hub is involved in representing these concepts (Bonner et al., 2009; Meteyard, Cuadrado, Bahrami, & Vigliocco, 2012; Shallice & Cooper, 2013). This view is motivated in part by a number of prominent single-case studies of patients with ATL damage who display a reversal of the typical concreteness effect e i.e., their comprehension of concrete concepts is disproportionately impaired relative to abstract (e.g., Macoir, 2009; Sirigu, Duhamel, & Poncet, 1991; Warrington, 1975). Some recent studies have failed to find this effect in larger case-series of semantic dementia (Hoffman, Jones, & Lambon Ralph, 2013; Hoffman and Lambon Ralph, 2011; Jefferies et al., 2009), suggesting that the “reversal” cases are unusual anomalies, though other studies are inconsistent with this view (Bonner et al., 2009; Loiselle et al., 2012; Yi, Moore, & Grossman, 2007). This apparent variability among patients with ATL damage may be a consequence of variations in the location and extent of damage in different patients. The pre- sent study allows for a greater degree of anatomical precision than is possible in neuropsychological studies. We found that a key region of vATL cortex e an area that is strongly linked to semantic deficits in semantic dementia (Mion et al., 2010) e is involved in the processing of abstract words as well as con- crete. This suggests that a common temporal lobe system supports comprehension of both word types. \n","\n","Visual checking that 1st index corresponds to the query...\n","\n","16 .....

Our task allowed us to directly compare 3 familiar categories for which subjects had a great deal of previously acquired conceptual knowledge, while being reasonably certain that subjects processed the categories at the same level of specificity and with the same amount of knowledge about the specific exemplars presented in the scanner. Although the specific exemplars were unfamiliar, subjects’ comprehension of the sentence stimuli meant that the task engaged retrieval of pre-existing category-knowledge. Good evidence for this comes from the neuroanatomical distribution of the activations we observed. Consider the person-fact learning condition. Learning facts about specific peoples’ occupations, ages, and places of birth activated regions previously demonstrated to represent biological motion (posterior STS; Beauchamp et al. 2002, 2003), mentalizing about other’s mental states (medial PFC; Amodio and Frith 2006; Frith 2007), and social perspec- tive-taking and representation of the self (precuneus; Cavanna and Trimble 2006). The facts learned by subjects about a particular person did not contain references to that person’s physical motions, their mental states, or social interactions, and thus these activations are neural signatures of conceptual inferences about the exemplars. Similarly, the hammer facts never described the hammers in motion, yet we can deduce that subjects were engaged in conceptual inference about the hammer exemplars because we observed activation in a region of the middle temporal gyrus known to represent nonbiological (tool) motion (Beauchamp et al. 2002). These activations further strengthen our confidence that the fact-learning task was successful at engendering conceptual processing, and warrants our claims about the anterior temporal lobe’s role in conceptual processing.\n","--> Our task allowed us to directly compare 3 familiar categories for which subjects had a great deal of previously acquired conceptual knowledge, while being reasonably certain that subjects processed the categories at the same level of specificity and with the same amount of knowledge about the specific exemplars presented in the scanner.

ATL showed sensitivity to both category and speci- ficity: early transient differences between conditions were seen within 100 ms (outside the main region of response to stimulus presentation in the time-frequency plots), which were fol- lowed by further significant differences between conditions from around 300 ms to the end of the analysis window.

First, in the motor and visual ‘spoke’ sites, and to a lesser extent in ATL, there were transient increases in oscillatory power particularly in the alpha band (shown in red in the total power plots for each condition relative to the passive period): this response occurred from about 100 ms post-stimulus onset, and was mostly insensitive to specificity and category (if anything, this response was actually stronger for superordinate matching trials, at least in the motor spoke; see Fig 3).

In addition to effects of specificity within ATL, our data revealed effects of specificity within the spokes, which were category-dependent. Event-related power decreases in a visual site in left posterior fusiform cortex were stronger during the identification of animals at the specific- level, while a motor site in central sulcus showed stronger event-related power decreases for manmade objects. Animals generally share many visual features (e.g., four legs, eyes etc.) and thus the identification of animal concepts at the specific-level is thought to require a greater contribution from visual cortex to allow for the discrimination between overlapping represen- tations [4]: e.g., the visual feature “stripy”‘ is critical to distinguishing a zebra from a horse. The posterior fusiform site also showed increased total oscillatory power during the superordi- nate categorisation of manmade objects: this might reflect the fact that manmade objects are more diverse and tend to have more unique visual features than animals; consequently, the identification of these objects at a superordinate level may require greater work within the visual system than the superordinate identification of animals [18, 19, 99, 100]. In addition, manipulable manmade objects have more prominent action features than animals and thus the identification of tools might require greater engagement of motor cortex (and other brain regions coding for visual motion and hand praxis) in concert with ATL [21, 101–109].

The location of MTG activation that was greater on Proto than Sub trials was more anterior (Brodamann area [BA] 21) to the canonical tool regions (BA 37, MT/V5) in the posterior MTG/ITG. Activation of the posterior MTG/ ITG (BA 37, MT/V5) has been reported for numerous tool-related perceptual and semantic processing studies, including selective visual processing for tools over animals, as well as naming pictures of tools and discriminating hand-tool motion (Chao et al. 1999; Chao and Martin 2000; Beauchamp et al. 2002, 2003; Noppeney et al. 2006; Perini et al. 2014). In this experiment, the canonical tool region of the posterior MTG/ITG was not significantly acti- vated. This may be due to the fact that the visual stimulus was more complex than a single tool and included objects, most of which were not typical tools, as well as words, and also did not involve tool or hand motion. As such, proto- typical tools, although the subject of a semantic memory guided visual search, were not a dominant visual feature and did not elicit consistent activation in the posterior tool perception regions that was detectable with the Proto pre- dictor time course.

The RTs for Proto trials were significantly faster than Sub trials suggesting that task difficulty could be a con- founding explanation with respect to the task differences in neural activity between Proto and Sub conditions. The PCC, which was more strongly activated for Proto trials in comparison to both the Sub and Imp trials, is a major node of the canonical default mode network (DMN; Buckner et al. 2008). Because activity of the DMN is known to correlate negatively with task difficulty (McKiernan et al. 2003), and the Proto condition seems less demanding in terms of processing time, the activation differences in the MTG and PCC could reflect that the DMN was less deactivated by Proto trials, as opposed to being directly involved in prototypical tool selection. Trial-specific RTs for the left and right hand responses were used as parametric predictors in the fMRI analyses, which accounts for some neural activity related to RTs, but it is not known to correlate with the DMN specifi- cally and does not protect altogether against finding dif- ferences in neural activity related to task difficulty. However, the canonical DMN regions that are associated with task-related deactivation include the medial pre- frontal cortex (PFC), PCC/precuneus, and lateral inferior parietal cortex, each bilaterally (Buckner et al. 2008), and does not typically include the MTG, which is reportedly anti-correlated with the PCC at rest (Udin et al. 2009). That we did not find a difference in the medial PFC, together with the left lateralized differences identified by the Sub condition and the positive relationship between the Proto predictor time course and both the MTG and PCC (i.e., they are not anticorrelated), suggest that the DMN per se was not differently deactivated between con- ditions, despite differences in RT and difficulty. Impor- tantly, some DMN nodes have been implicated in semantic processing (Binder and Desai 2011; Wirth et al. 2011), and may become involved in certain types of semantic memory-guided behaviors. With this in mind, finding that some nodes of the DMN, such as the PCC, are involved during prototypical tool selection in combi- nation with more common semantic memory regions in the anterior temporal cortex supports the notion that it is mediated by semantic memory processing. Moreover, the longer RTs for Sub trials are consistent with the notion that more attributes (i.e., structural and physical proper- ties, motor affordances) of the visual stimulus need to be processed in order to choose a sufficient substitute. In sum, despite differences in RT, evidence advocates that resources specific to each task condition were identified by the contrasting neural activation rather than a con- founding activation difference due to task difficulty.\n","--> The RTs for Proto trials were significantly faster than Sub trials suggesting that task difficulty could be a con- founding explanation with respect to the task differences in neural activity between Proto and Sub conditions. The PCC, which was more strongly activated for Proto trials in comparison to both the Sub and Imp trials, is a major node of the canonical default mode network (DMN; Buckner et al. 2008). Because activity of the DMN is known to correlate negatively with task difficulty (McKiernan et al. 2003), and the Proto condition seems less demanding in terms of processing time, the activation differences in the MTG and PCC could reflect that the DMN was less deactivated by Proto trials, as opposed to being directly involved in prototypical tool selection. Trial-specific RTs for the left and right hand responses were used as parametric predictors in the fMRI analyses, which accounts for some neural activity related to RTs, but it is not known to correlate with the DMN specifi- cally and does not protect altogether against finding dif- ferences in neural activity related to task difficulty. However, the canonical DMN regions that are associated with task-related deactivation include the medial pre- frontal cortex (PFC), PCC/precuneus, and lateral inferior parietal cortex, each bilaterally (Buckner et al. 2008), and does not typically include the MTG, which is reportedly anti-correlated with the PCC at rest (Udin et al. 2009). That we did not find a difference in the medial PFC, together with the left lateralized differences identified by the Sub condition and the positive relationship between the Proto predictor time course and both the MTG and PCC (i.e., they are not anticorrelated), suggest that the DMN per se was not differently deactivated between con- ditions, despite differences in RT and difficulty. Impor- tantly, some DMN nodes have been implicated in semantic processing (Binder and Desai 2011; Wirth et al. 2011), and may become involved in certain types of semantic memory-guided behaviors. With this in mind, finding that some nodes of the DMN, such as the PCC, are involved during prototypical tool selection in combi- nation with more common semantic memory regions in the anterior temporal cortex supports the notion that it is mediated by semantic memory processing. Moreover, the longer RTs for Sub trials are consistent with the notion that more attributes (i.e., structural and physical proper- ties, motor affordances) of the visual stimulus need to be processed in order to choose a sufficient substitute. In sum, despite differences in RT, evidence advocates that resources specific to each task condition were identified by the contrasting neural activation rather than a con- founding activation difference due to task difficulty. \n","\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"K-kPqNKeefU2","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Full paper splitted into paragraphs\n","shelf = shelve.open(\"automatic_split\") \n","shelf[\"my_dict\"] = paired\n","shelf.close()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UkVsqDioefU9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
